    "text": "Literature Review\n\nBackground on Off-Task Behavior Detection\nOff-task behavior detection in educational settings has been an area of active research for several years, with studies employing various approaches to identify and analyze student disengagement.\n\nTraditional Methods\nEarly research relied heavily on human observation and self-reporting techniques. While these methods provided rich qualitative data, they were often subjective, time-consuming, and not scalable for large-scale implementation (Baker 2007).\n\n\nMachine Learning Approaches\nThe advent of intelligent tutoring systems and educational software has enabled more sophisticated detection methods using machine learning:\n\nLog File Analysis: Researchers have developed models that analyze student interaction logs to identify patterns indicative of off-task behavior. These models often utilize features such as time spent on tasks, response correctness, and help-seeking behavior (Cocea and Weibelzahl 2009; Pardos et al. 2014).\nMultimodal Detection: Some studies have incorporated multiple data sources to create more comprehensive off-task behavior detection systems (Bosch et al. 2015).\nTemporal Models: Researchers have explored the use of sequential models to capture the temporal aspects of student behavior and improve detection accuracy (Liu and Koedinger 2017).\n\n\n\nChallenges in Off-Task Behavior Detection\nSeveral challenges have been identified in the field:\n\nClass Imbalance: Off-task behavior is typically less frequent than on-task behavior, leading to imbalanced datasets that can skew model performance (Pardos et al. 2014).\nContext Sensitivity: The definition of off-task behavior can vary depending on the learning environment and task making it difficult to create universally applicable models (Baker 2007).\nPrivacy Concerns: As detection methods become more sophisticated, they often require more invasive data collection, raising ethical and privacy issues (Bosch et al. 2015). This is particularly relevant in educational settings where student data protection is paramount.\nReal-time Detection: Developing models that can detect off-task behavior in real-time to enable immediate intervention remains a significant challenge (Liu and Koedinger 2017), especially in resource-constrained educational environments.\n\n\n\nRecent Trends\nRecent research has focused on:\n\nPersonalized Models: Developing detection systems that adapt to individual student behaviors and learning patterns (Pardos et al. 2014).\nInterpretable AI: Creating models that not only detect off-task behavior but also provide insights into the reasons behind it (Cocea and Weibelzahl 2009). This trend aligns with this study’s focus on model comparison and evaluation metrics, as interpretable models can offer valuable insights for educators.\nIntegration with Intervention Strategies: Combining detection models with automated intervention systems to re-engage students in real-time (Liu and Koedinger 2017).\n\n\n\nEducational Context in e-Learning Environments\nIn the context of e-learning environments, off-task behavior can significantly impact learning outcomes. Cocea and Weibelzahl found that students who frequently engage in off-task behavior in e-learning environments show lower learning gains and decreased problem-solving skills (Cocea and Weibelzahl 2009). The abstract nature of some concepts makes sustained engagement crucial for skill development, highlighting the importance of accurate off-task behavior detection in these environments.\nMy study builds upon existing work by addressing the persistent challenge of class imbalance and exploring advanced machine learning techniques to improve off-task behavior detection accuracy. A focus on threshold optimization and model comparison provides valuable insights into the practical implementation of these detection systems in educational settings, particularly for tutoring systems where maintaining student engagement is critical for learning success.\nBy comparing multiple classifiers and employing techniques like SMOTE, this research contributes to the ongoing effort to develop more robust and accurate off-task behavior detection models. Furthermore, an emphasis on performance metrics such as Cohen’s Kappa and F1-score addresses the need for comprehensive evaluation in imbalanced datasets, a critical aspect often overlooked in previous studies."

    "text": "Methodology\nThis study employed a multi-step approach to develop and evaluate machine learning models:\n\nData Preparation: I utilized a dataset containing features related to student behavior, with a binary target variable indicating off-task status (OffTask: Y/N).\nData Overview: The dataset contains 616 student interactions with a close-loop tutoring system. Each entry includes 29 features capturing various aspects of student performance, such as correctness of responses, help-seeking behavior, and time spent on tasks. Key features include:\n\nBinary indicator of off-task behavior\nPerformance metrics (e.g., average correct responses, errors)\nTime-related features\nError and help-seeking metrics\nRecent performance indicators\n\n\nThis data allows for analysis of learning patterns and the effectiveness of the tutoring system in teaching.\n\nModel Selection: I implemented three classifiers: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting.\nHandling Class Imbalance: To address the imbalanced nature of the dataset, I applied the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).\nHyperparameter Tuning: I used GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters, focusing on maximizing the F1-score.\nThreshold Optimization: I explored various decision thresholds to balance precision and recall, particularly for the minority class (off-task behavior).\nPerformance Evaluation: I assessed model performance using metrics such as Cohen’s Kappa score, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.\nCross-Validation: I employed k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance estimates across different data subsets.\n\n\nData Preparation\nI began by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset:\n\n# Import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score, GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, cohen_kappa_score, confusion_matrix\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Load the dataset\ndata = pd.read_csv('data/ca1-dataset.csv')\n\nI then prepared the data by encoding the target variable and selecting relevant features:\n\n# Prepare the data\ndata['OffTask'] = data['OffTask'].map({'N': 0, 'Y': 1})  # Encode target variable\nX = data.drop(columns=['Unique-id', 'namea', 'OffTask'])  # Features\ny = data['OffTask']  # Target variable\n\n\n\nHandling Class Imbalance with SMOTE\nThe dataset exhibited class imbalance, with significantly more instances of “Not OffTask” than “OffTask.” To address this issue, I applied SMOTE to the training data:\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Apply SMOTE to the training data\nsmote = SMOTE(random_state=42)\nX_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Calculate the ratio of classes\nclass_0_count = sum(y_train_resampled == 0)\nclass_1_count = sum(y_train_resampled == 1)\nratio_of_classes = class_0_count / class_1_count\n\n\n\nModel Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning\n\nRandom Forest Classifier\nI defined the Random Forest model and set up a parameter grid for hyperparameter tuning:\n\n# Define the model\nmodel_rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, class_weight='balanced')\n\n# Define the parameter grid\nparam_grid_rf = {\n    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],\n    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],\n    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],\n    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4]\n}\n\n# Set up GridSearchCV with corrected parameter names and variables\ngrid_search_rf = GridSearchCV(estimator=model_rf, param_grid=param_grid_rf,\n                              scoring='f1', cv=5, n_jobs=-1, verbose=2)\n\n# Fit GridSearchCV\ngrid_search_rf.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)\n\n# Best parameters\nprint(\"Best parameters found for Random Forest: \", grid_search_rf.best_params_)\n\nFitting 5 folds for each of 108 candidates, totalling 540 fits\nBest parameters found for Random Forest:  {'max_depth': 20, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 50}\n\n\n\n\nXGBoost Classifier\nI initialized the XGBoost model, adjusting for class imbalance using scale_pos_weight:\n\n# Define the XGBoost model\nxgb_model = XGBClassifier(eval_metric='logloss', scale_pos_weight=ratio_of_classes)\n\n# Fit the model\nxgb_model.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)\n\nXGBClassifier(base_score=None, booster=None, callbacks=None,\n              colsample_bylevel=None, colsample_bynode=None,\n              colsample_bytree=None, device=None, early_stopping_rounds=None,\n              enable_categorical=False, eval_metric='logloss',\n              feature_types=None, gamma=None, grow_policy=None,\n              importance_type=None, interaction_constraints=None,\n              learning_rate=None, max_bin=None, max_cat_threshold=None,\n              max_cat_to_onehot=None, max_delta_step=None, max_depth=None,\n              max_leaves=None, min_child_weight=None, missing=nan,\n              monotone_constraints=None, multi_strategy=None, n_estimators=None,\n              n_jobs=None, num_parallel_tree=None, random_state=None, ...)In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\nWhile this study provides valuable insights into off-task behavior detection in tutoring systems, it’s important to acknowledge several limitations:\n\nDataset Constraints\n\nSize: The dataset, while substantial, is limited to 616 student interactions. A larger dataset might reveal additional patterns or improve model generalizability.\nContext: The data may not generalize well to cerain subjects or learning environments.\nTemporal aspects: The data represents a snapshot in time and doesn’t capture long-term changes in student behavior or learning patterns.\n\n\n\nFeature Selection\n\nLimited feature set: I relied on 29 pre-defined features. There may be other relevant features not captured in the dataset that could improve detection accuracy.\nFeature interpretability: Some features, particularly those related to recent performance indicators, are challenging to interpret in an educational context.\n\n\n\nModel Limitations\n\nModel selection: While I compared several classifiers, there are other advanced models (e.g., deep learning architectures) that I didn’t explore due to computational constraints.\nHyperparameter tuning: Despite using GridSearchCV, I may not have exhaustively explored all possible hyperparameter combinations.\n\n\n\nClass Imbalance Handling\n\nSMOTE limitations: While SMOTE helped address class imbalance, it generates synthetic examples which may not perfectly represent real-world off-task behavior.\nAlternative techniques: Other class imbalance handling techniques (e.g., adaptive boosting, cost-sensitive learning) were not explored and could potentially yield different results.\n\n\n\nPerformance Metrics\n\nMetric selection: I focused on Cohen’s Kappa and F1-score. Other metrics might provide additional insights into model performance.\nThreshold sensitivity: The results are sensitive to the chosen decision threshold, which may not be optimal for all use cases.\n\n\n\nGeneralizability\n\nStudent population: The dataset may not represent the full diversity of student populations, potentially limiting the model’s applicability across different demographics.\nEducational system specificity: The patterns of off-task behavior detected may be specific to the particular tutoring systems used and might not generalize to other educational software.\n\n\n\nReal-world Application\n\nReal-time detection: This study doesn’t address the challenges of implementing these models for real-time off-task behavior detection in live classroom settings.\nComputational resources: The computational requirements for running these models may be a limiting factor for widespread adoption in resource-constrained educational environments.\n\n\n\nLack of Qualitative Insights\n\nStudent perspective: My quantitative approach does not capture students’ own perceptions of their engagement or reasons for off-task behavior.\nContextual factors: Environmental or personal factors that might influence off-task behavior are not accounted for in the model.\n\n\n\nValidation in Live Settings\n\nControlled environment: The models were developed and tested on historical data. Their performance in live, dynamic classroom environments remains to be validated.\n\nThese limitations provide opportunities for future research to build upon and refine my approach to off-task behavior detection in educational settings."

    "text": "Ethical Considerations in Off-Task Behavior Detection\nThe implementation of off-task behavior detection systems in educational settings raises several ethical concerns that researchers and practitioners must carefully consider:\n\nPrivacy and Data Protection\n\nCollection of sensitive data: Off-task behavior detection often involves collecting detailed data about student activities, potentially including keystroke patterns, eye movements, or even facial expressions. This level of monitoring raises significant privacy concerns.\nData storage and security: Ensuring the secure storage and transmission of student data is crucial to prevent unauthorized access or breaches.\nCompliance with regulations: Researchers must adhere to data protection regulations such as GDPR in Europe or FERPA and COPPA in the United States, which have strict guidelines on handling student data.\n\n\n\nInformed Consent\n\nStudent awareness: Students (and their parents/guardians for minors) should be fully informed about what data is being collected, how it will be used, and who will have access to it.\nOpt-out options: Providing students with the ability to opt-out of monitoring without academic penalty is an important ethical consideration.\n\n\n\nBias and Fairness\n\nAlgorithmic bias: Machine learning models may inadvertently perpetuate or amplify existing biases related to race, gender, or socioeconomic status. Ensuring fairness in off-task behavior detection across diverse student populations is crucial.\nCultural sensitivity: What constitutes “off-task” behavior may vary across cultures, and detection systems should be designed with cultural differences in mind.\n\n\n\nTransparency and Explainability\n\nInterpretable models: Using interpretable AI models allows for better understanding of how off-task behavior is being detected, which is important for both educators and students.\nClear communication: The criteria for determining off-task behavior should be clearly communicated to students and educators.\n\n\n\nPotential for Misuse\n\nOver-reliance on technology: There’s a risk that educators might rely too heavily on automated systems, potentially overlooking important contextual factors in student behavior.\nPunitive use: Safeguards should be in place to prevent the use of off-task behavior data for punitive measures rather than supportive interventions.\n\n\n\nPsychological Impact\n\nStress and anxiety: Constant monitoring could lead to increased stress and anxiety among students, potentially impacting their learning and well-being.\nSelf-fulfilling prophecies: Labeling students as frequently “off-task” could negatively impact their self-perception and motivation.\n\n\n\nData Retention and Right to be Forgotten\n\nLimited data retention: Implementing policies for how long data is kept and when it should be deleted.\nStudent rights: Allowing students to request the deletion of their data, especially after they’ve left the educational institution.\n\n\n\nContextual Considerations\n\nFlexibility in detection: Recognizing that brief off-task moments can be part of the learning process and not always detrimental.\nAdaptive systems: Developing systems that can adapt to individual student learning styles and needs.\n\n\n\nStakeholder Involvement\n\nInclusive design: Involving educators, students, and parents in the design and implementation of off-task behavior detection systems.\nOngoing evaluation: Regularly assessing the impact and effectiveness of these systems with input from all stakeholders.\n\nBy addressing these ethical considerations, researchers and educators can work towards developing off-task behavior detection systems that are not only effective but also respect student rights, promote fairness, and contribute positively to the learning environment."

    "text": "Literature Review\n\nDetecting Off-Task Behavior and Addressing Algorithmic Bias in Learning Systems\nEducational Data Mining (EDM) has emerged as a significant field, leveraging student data to enhance learning outcomes. Recent research has focused on developing algorithms and metrics to address algorithmic bias in education and other related fields (Cohausz, Kappenberger, and Stuckenschmidt 2024). Analyzing student data can provide valuable insights into factors influencing academic performance, including social connections (Siemens and Baker 2012).\nA particularly relevant area within EDM for this study is detecting student misuse of educational systems. Baker and Siemens (Siemens and Baker 2012) explored how data mining techniques can identify instances where students “game the system” in constraint-based tutors. This concept is pertinent to identifying off-task behavior, a broader category of student misuse.\nOff-task behavior encompasses actions where students deviate from their intended engagement with educational software, including disengagement, inappropriate tool use, or attempts to circumvent learning activities. “Gaming the system” (Ryan SJD Baker, Yacef, et al. 2009) can be understood as a specific manifestation of off-task behavior in which students exploit system mechanics to achieve desired outcomes without genuine engagement.\nOther relevant methodologies and ethical considerations include:\n\nThe use of “text replays” to gain a deeper understanding of student behavior (Sao Pedro, Baker, and Gobert 2012; Slater, Baker, and Wang 2020), which could potentially be adapted for analyzing off-task behavior patterns.\nAddressing fairness and bias in machine learning models used in educational contexts (Cohausz, Kappenberger, and Stuckenschmidt 2024; Ryan S. Baker and Hawn 2022), ensuring that models for detecting off-task behavior are equitable and do not unfairly disadvantage certain student groups."

However, based on feedback from Jiayi Zhang, I updated my strategy to employ GroupKFold cross-validation based on namea. This approach groups data by students, ensuring all data from one student is used for training or testing, not split between both. It prevents data leakage across folds, as logs from the same student will not appear in both sets—crucial in educational data mining due to highly individual student behavior. Cross-validating based on namea allows the model to learn from some students’ behavior patterns and generalize to others, mirroring real-world usage where the detector should work for new students. This method better indicates the model’s ability to generalize and ensures a more robust, fair evaluation.\nImplementation:\n\n# Cross-validation using GroupKFold with the ensemble model\ngkf = GroupKFold(n_splits=5)\ngroups = ca1_enhanced['namea']  # Change from 'Unique-id' to 'namea'\n\nauc_scores_comb = []\nkappa_scores_comb = []\n\nfor train_idx, test_idx in gkf.split(X_combined, y, groups=groups):\n    X_train_comb, X_test_comb = X_combined.iloc[train_idx], X_combined.iloc[test_idx]\n    y_train_comb, y_test_comb = y.iloc[train_idx], y.iloc[test_idx]\n    \n    # Apply SMOTE to each fold\n    X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train_comb, y_train_comb)\n    \n    ensemble.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)\n    y_pred_comb = ensemble.predict(X_test_comb)\n    auc_scores_comb.append(roc_auc_score(y_test_comb, y_pred_comb))\n    kappa_scores_comb.append(cohen_kappa_score(y_test_comb, y_pred_comb))\n\n# Averaged cross-validation results for combined features with ensemble\navg_auc_comb = sum(auc_scores_comb) / len(auc_scores_comb)\navg_kappa_comb = sum(kappa_scores_comb) / len(kappa_scores_comb)\nprint(f'Average AUC for Combined Features with Ensemble: {avg_auc_comb}')\nprint(f'Average Kappa for Combined Features with Ensemble: {avg_kappa_comb}')\n\nVotingClassifier(estimators=[('rf',\n                              RandomForestClassifier(bootstrap=False,\n                                                     max_depth=10,\n                                                     min_samples_leaf=2,\n                                                     random_state=42)),\n                             ('lr',\n                              LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000,\n                                                 random_state=42)),\n                             ('svc', SVC(probability=True, random_state=42))],\n                 voting='soft')In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

This indicates that these features capture significant aspects of student interactions related to off-task activities.\nHyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the Random Forest parameters led to better model performance, highlighting the importance of tailoring the model to the data characteristics.\nAddressing Class Imbalance: Applying SMOTE balanced the training data, which is crucial when dealing with imbalanced classes. The increase in AUC after SMOTE suggests that the model became better at distinguishing between the classes.\nEnsemble Modeling: Combining different algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVC) in an ensemble improved the robustness of the predictions. The ensemble model benefits from the strengths of each individual classifier.\nFeature Selection with RFE: Reducing the feature set to the most significant 10 features using RFE not only simplified the model but also enhanced performance. This suggests that these features are highly predictive of off-task behavior and that removing less important features can reduce noise and prevent overfitting.\nCross-Validation Insights: The cross-validation results, while lower than the test set scores, are critical for assessing how the model might perform on new, unseen data. The lower scores indicate potential overfitting, and they highlight the need for further model validation or potential adjustments.\n\n\nImplications for Educational Interventions\n\nThe top features identified can help educators understand which behaviors are most indicative of off-task activities.\nReal-time monitoring systems can be developed using these key features to alert educators when a student may need intervention.\nThe improved accuracy of off-task behavior detection can lead to more timely and targeted support for students, potentially improving learning outcomes."

    "text": "Limitations and Future Work\nDespite the promising results, several limitations must be acknowledged:\n\nDataset Size: The relatively small dataset may limit the model’s generalizability to broader student populations.\nPotential Overfitting: The discrepancy between test set and cross-validation performance suggests potential overfitting, which needs to be addressed in future iterations.\nFeature Availability: Some engineered features may not be immediately available in real-time scenarios, potentially limiting the model’s applicability in live educational settings.\nExternal Validation: The model has not been tested on external datasets or in real-world educational environments, which is crucial for assessing its true effectiveness.\n\nFuture work should focus on:\n\nExpanding the Dataset: Collecting more diverse data from a larger student population to improve model generalizability.\nReal-time Feature Engineering: Developing methods to calculate and update features in real-time for live intervention systems.\nAdvanced Model Architectures: Exploring deep learning approaches or more sophisticated ensemble methods that might capture complex patterns in student behavior.\nLongitudinal Studies: Conducting long-term studies to assess the model’s effectiveness in improving student engagement and learning outcomes over time.\nInterpretability: Developing tools to explain model predictions to educators and students, ensuring transparency and trust in the system."

    "section": "Methods Used",
    "text": "Methods Used\n\nFactor Analysis\nFactor Analysis was chosen as the primary method to discover the underlying latent skills in the dataset. The goal was to identify groups of items that likely measure the same skill based on their relationships. Initially, we selected 3 components to represent the skills expected to be present. This model was iterated to explore variations by changing the number of components to 2, 3, and 4 to test the model’s robustness.\n\nWhy Factor Analysis?: Factor Analysis helps uncover hidden relationships between observed variables, which in this context were test items. By reducing dimensionality, it allows us to understand which items correlate with specific skills without explicit prior information.\n\n\n\nBarnes’s Q-Matrix Method (Simulated using KMeans Clustering)\nBarnes’s Q-Matrix method was simulated using KMeans Clustering to explore item groupings into potential latent skills. Items were clustered into three skill groups to verify if the clusters aligned with our findings from Factor Analysis.\n\nWhy KMeans Clustering?: KMeans provides an alternative approach to grouping items based on their response patterns. This allows us to cross-check if the factor analysis findings are supported by unsupervised clustering.\n\n\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)\nPCA was used as an analogy to Learning Factors Transfer Analysis. It helped determine if skills could be identified using a component-based approach, examining how many latent factors best fit the data.\n\nWhy PCA?: PCA is another dimensionality reduction technique that helps identify variance and possible groupings of items in the dataset. It was used to validate the relationships found using Factor Analysis."

    "text": "Evidence for Best Mapping\n\nJustification for the Final Q-Matrix\nThe final Q-matrix was derived from the 3-component Factor Analysis model as it struck the right balance between complexity and interpretability. The evidence from clustering and PCA supported the majority of item-skill groupings found in Factor Analysis.\n\nConsistency Across Methods: Items 2, 4, and 6 consistently mapped to Skill_1, while items 3, 7, and 8 were linked to Skill_2 across most methods. Items 1 and 5 were distinctly associated with Skill_3, particularly highlighted in both PCA and Factor Analysis.\nVisual Confirmation: Heatmaps illustrated the relationships clearly, indicating strong loadings for items corresponding to specific skills. Individual bar charts helped confirm these findings by breaking down each item’s relationship with all skills.\nIterative Testing: We tested models with different component numbers. The 2-component model was overly simplistic, failing to represent some item relationships adequately. The 4-component model, while providing additional nuance, introduced unnecessary complexity without significant gain in interpretability.\n\n\n\nDecision-Making Process\nThe decision to choose the 3-component Factor Analysis model was made after careful comparison of different models and their visual representations. It was apparent that this model effectively captured key latent skills without overfitting or oversimplifying the relationships. Thus, the final Q-matrix was chosen based on its ability to coherently explain the data with support from multiple perspectives (Factor Analysis, KMeans, PCA)."
