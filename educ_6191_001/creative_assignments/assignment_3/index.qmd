  This report presents a comprehensive approach to identifying the knowledge structure in an eight-item test dataset by using advanced statistical methods. The methods applied include Factor Analysis, Barnes's Q-Matrix method (simulated through KMeans Clustering), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Factor Analysis was primarily used to uncover latent skills, and its results were cross-validated through KMeans and PCA. The implementation involved comparing models with different numbers of components, ranging from two to four, to determine the optimal skill representation. Visualizations, such as heatmaps and bar charts, were used to assess the model's effectiveness. The final Q-matrix was selected based on its ability to balance complexity with interpretability, providing a robust mapping of items to latent skills. The findings indicate that a three-component Factor Analysis model best captures the relationships among test items, effectively identifying three distinct skills while avoiding overfitting or oversimplification.

## Introduction

The purpose of this report is to investigate the knowledge structure underlying an 8-item test dataset by employing various statistical and machine learning methods. Knowledge structure mapping is crucial in understanding how different test items relate to latent skills, which can aid in developing educational tools, improving assessments, and tailoring instruction to student needs. This study uses Factor Analysis, KMeans clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore and validate item-skill relationships, ultimately determining the most suitable skill structure representation for the dataset. By applying these methods, we aim to derive a comprehensive Q-matrix that effectively maps items to underlying skills, facilitating better interpretation of test results.

## Background and Related Work

### Knowledge Structure Mapping

**Knowledge structure mapping**, the process of analyzing and visualizing learners' conceptual understanding and cognitive organization of information, is fundamental to educational data mining [@gordon2003learning]. There are various methods and applications, showing how researchers represent relationships between different pieces of knowledge.  

One key method is **Learning Factors Analysis (LFA)**, used to evaluate and refine cognitive models [@cen2006learning]. This approach is crucial because it uses data to improve the accuracy of these models, which then leads to more effective personalized learning. 

**Partial Order Knowledge Spaces (POKS)** also provide a powerful framework for representing knowledge structures. POKS uses partially ordered sets of skills, which is helpful in understanding how knowledge builds upon itself [@desmarais2006learned,]. For example, a student might need to master addition before moving on to multiplication.  

**Factor Analysis**, another statistical technique, is also useful for knowledge structure mapping.  It helps uncover hidden relationships between items and skills, providing a data-driven approach [@beavers2019practical]. For example, it can reveal that certain test questions are highly correlated and therefore measure a similar underlying skill.

**Barnes’s Q-matrix method** is a specific way to represent the relationship between items and skills using a binary matrix [@barnes2005q]. This method is widely used in cognitive modeling and educational data mining. A Q-matrix can visually depict which skills are required to answer specific test questions.

These concepts are applied in various contexts:

- **Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs):**  Knowledge structure mapping is crucial for ITSs to personalize instruction and provide tailored feedback [@de2008educational].
- **Predicting Student Performance:**  Understanding knowledge structures can help predict student performance on assessments and identify students at risk of falling behind [@de2008educational].
- **Analyzing Student Behavior:**  Knowledge structure mapping can be used to analyze student behavior, such as help-seeking patterns, and understand how students approach learning tasks [@cukurova2022learning].

The importance of using data-driven approaches to understand and improve educational systems cannot be under stated.  The use of machine learning and data mining techniques allows researchers to uncover patterns and relationships that might not be apparent through traditional methods [@chen2018knowedu]. Different techniques can be used to understand how knowledge is organized and this understanding can be applied to improve educational practices.

## Methods Used

### Factor Analysis

Factor Analysis was chosen as the primary method to discover the underlying latent skills in the dataset. The goal was to identify groups of items that likely measure the same skill based on their relationships. Initially, we selected 3 components to represent the skills expected to be present. This model was iterated to explore variations by changing the number of components to 2, 3, and 4 to test the model's robustness.

- **Why Factor Analysis?**: Factor Analysis helps uncover hidden relationships between observed variables, which in this context were test items. By reducing dimensionality, it allows us to understand which items correlate with specific skills without explicit prior information.

### Barnes's Q-Matrix Method (Simulated using KMeans Clustering)

Barnes's Q-Matrix method was simulated using **KMeans Clustering** to explore item groupings into potential latent skills. Items were clustered into three skill groups to verify if the clusters aligned with our findings from Factor Analysis.

- **Why KMeans Clustering?**: KMeans provides an alternative approach to grouping items based on their response patterns. This allows us to cross-check if the factor analysis findings are supported by unsupervised clustering.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA was used as an analogy to **Learning Factors Transfer Analysis**. It helped determine if skills could be identified using a component-based approach, examining how many latent factors best fit the data.

- **Why PCA?**: PCA is another dimensionality reduction technique that helps identify variance and possible groupings of items in the dataset. It was used to validate the relationships found using Factor Analysis.

## Implementation Details

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Loading the Data

The dataset was loaded using the pandas library. The data consisted of responses for eight test items from multiple students.
```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/8items.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
data.head()
```

#### Factor Analysis**

Factor Analysis was performed with three components to determine the skill structure, then repeated with four and two components to explore alternate structures. The `FactorAnalysis` module from `sklearn.decomposition` was used.

```{python}
from sklearn.decomposition import FactorAnalysis

# Extract item data (excluding the 'student' column)
item_data = data.drop(columns=['student'])

# Fit a Factor Analysis model to identify latent skills
# We'll start with trying to identify 3 latent factors (skills)
n_factors = 3
fa_model = FactorAnalysis(n_components=n_factors, random_state=42)
fa_model.fit(item_data)

# Get the factor loadings to understand item-skill relationships
factor_loadings = fa_model.components_.T

# Create a DataFrame to visualize the factor loadings
factor_loadings_df = pd.DataFrame(factor_loadings, index=item_data.columns, columns=[f'Skill_{i+1}' for i in range(n_factors)])
print(factor_loadings_df)
```
This code extracts the item data, fits a Factor Analysis model with three components, and visualizes the resulting factor loadings to understand the relationships between items and skills.

#### KMeans Clustering

KMeans clustering was applied to transpose the item data and determine optimal groupings, representing item-skill relationships.

```{python}
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Transpose the item data so clustering is applied to items rather than students
item_data_transposed = item_data.T

# Apply KMeans clustering with 3 clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(item_data_transposed)

# Get the cluster labels assigned to each item
cluster_labels = kmeans.labels_

# Create a DataFrame to visualize item-skill mapping
kmeans_q_matrix_df = pd.DataFrame({'Item': item_data.columns, 'Mapped_Skill': [f'Skill_{label+1}' for label in cluster_labels]})
print(kmeans_q_matrix_df)
```
This code applies KMeans clustering to determine optimal groupings of items into three clusters, representing potential latent skills. The resulting DataFrame shows the skill to which each item is mapped.

#### Learning Factors Transfer Analysis

Learning Factors Transfer Analysis (LFTA) using PCA with three components was applied to identify major components underlying the item responses.

```{python}
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Perform PCA with three components
pca_model = PCA(n_components=3)
pca_model.fit(item_data)

# Get the PCA loadings for each item
pca_loadings = pca_model.components_.T

# Create a DataFrame to visualize the PCA loadings
pca_loadings_df = pd.DataFrame(pca_loadings, index=item_data.columns, columns=['Skill_1', 'Skill_2', 'Skill_3'])
print(pca_loadings_df)
```
This code applies PCA to identify the major components underlying the item responses. The loadings are then visualized to understand the relationships between items and latent skills.

#### Key findings from the analysis

I created a Q-matrix to map each item to the skill with which it has the highest loading.

```{python}
# Determine the skill with the highest loading for each item from PCA
pca_q_matrix = pca_loadings_df.idxmax(axis=1)

# Create the Q-matrix as a DataFrame, showing the mapping between items and skills
pca_q_matrix_df = pd.DataFrame({'Item': item_data.columns, 'Mapped_Skill': pca_q_matrix.values})
pca_q_matrix_df
```
Then, I created a Mermaid diagram to help visualize this comparison across the three methods.

1. **Consistent Grouping**:
   - Items 2, 4, and 6 consistently group together across all methods (though labeled as Skill_1 in Factor Analysis but Skill_2 in others)
   - Barnes's Q-matrix and PCA show perfect alignment in their groupings

2. **Method Differences**:
   - Factor Analysis differs most from the other two methods
   - Barnes's Q-matrix and PCA show identical groupings
   - Item 5's classification varies (Skill_2 in Factor Analysis, Skill_3 in others)

3. **Most Reliable Associations**:
   - The grouping of Items 2, 4, and 6 appears most reliable
   - Items 1 and 5 show strong association with Skill_3 in two methods
   - Items 3, 7, and 8 consistently group together in Barnes's and PCA methods

This suggests that while there are some variations across methods, there are clear patterns in how items cluster together, particularly for Items 2, 4, and 6.

```

1. **Consistent Groupings**:
   - **Skill_1 Cluster**: Items 3, 7, and 8 show consistent high loadings
   - **Skill_2 Cluster**: Items 2, 4, and 6 maintain strong relationships

2. **Complex Relationships**:
   - Items 1 and 5 show split influences between Skill_3 and Skill_4
   - Item 4 demonstrates some secondary loading on Skill_4

3. **Model Implications**:
   - The 4-component model reveals more nuanced relationships
   - Some items (1, 5) may require multiple skills
   - The original discrepancies might be explained by these complex relationships

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Consider evaluating a simpler two-skill model
   - Further investigation of items with split influences
   - Assess whether the added complexity of four skills provides meaningful improvement

This analysis suggests that while some item-skill relationships are very stable, others show more complex patterns that might explain the initial discrepancies across different analysis methods.

#### Key findings from the model comparisons

fa_model_simpler = FactorAnalysis(n_components=n_factors_simpler, random_state=42)
fa_model_simpler.fit(item_data)

# Get the factor loadings for the two-component model
factor_loadings_simpler = fa_model_simpler.components_.T

# Create a DataFrame to visualize the factor loadings for the two-component model
factor_loadings_simpler_df = pd.DataFrame(factor_loadings_simpler, index=item_data.columns, columns=[f'Skill_{i+1}' for i in range(n_factors_simpler)])

```

1. **Two-Component Model**:
   - Effectively groups most items into two clear skills
   - Items 2, 4, 6 → Skill_1
   - Items 3, 5, 7, 8 → Skill_2
   - Cannot adequately capture Item 1's relationships
   - Too simplistic to capture nuanced relationships

2. **Three-Component Model**:
   - Provides balanced representation
   - Clear, distinct groupings
   - Successfully captures Item 1's relationship
   - Optimal balance between simplicity and explanatory power

3. **Four-Component Model**:
   - Reveals additional complexity
   - Shows split influences for Items 1 and 5
   - May be unnecessarily complex
   - Adds granularity but possibly redundant information

4. **Model Selection Implications**:
   - Three-component model appears optimal
   - Balances complexity with explanatory power
   - Captures key relationships without redundancy
   - Provides clear, interpretable groupings

The analysis suggests that the three-component model offers the most efficient and effective representation of the skill-item relationships, avoiding both oversimplification and unnecessary complexity.

#### Visualizations

Heatmaps and bar charts were created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize relationships between items and skills, making it easier to interpret and validate findings.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create a heatmap to visualize item-skill relationships from Factor Analysis
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(factor_loadings_df, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', linewidths=0.5, linecolor='black', cbar=True)
plt.title('Item-Skill Relationships (Factor Analysis with 3 Components)')
plt.xlabel('Skills')
plt.ylabel('Items')
plt.show()
```
```{python}
# Create bar charts for each item to show its relationship across skills
num_items = len(factor_loadings_df.index)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(num_items, 1, figsize=(9, num_items * 2))

for i, item in enumerate(factor_loadings_df.index):
    axes[i].bar(factor_loadings_df.columns, factor_loadings_df.loc[item], color='skyblue')
    axes[i].set_title(f'Relationship of {item} with Skills')
    axes[i].set_ylabel('Loading Value')
    axes[i].set_ylim(-1, 1)

plt.tight_layout()

plt.show()
```

## Model Assessment

### Evaluating the Goodness of Fit

- **Factor Loadings**: The factor loadings for each item were examined to determine which skill had the highest influence. The loading values helped us decide the optimal number of components.
- **Comparison Across Models**: Models with two, three, and four components were compared to evaluate the consistency of item-skill groupings. The goal was to identify which model explained the data most intuitively without overcomplicating relationships.
- **Visualizations**: Heatmaps and bar charts were utilized to visualize the relationships between items and skills. This provided insight into which model (in terms of the number of components) best captured the underlying structure.

## Evidence for Best Mapping

### Justification for the Final Q-Matrix

The final Q-matrix was derived from the three-component Factor Analysis model as it struck the right balance between complexity and interpretability. The evidence from clustering and PCA supported the majority of item-skill groupings found in Factor Analysis.

- **Consistency Across Methods**: Items 2, 4, and 6 consistently mapped to **Skill\_1**, while items 3, 7, and 8 were linked to **Skill\_2** across most methods. Items 1 and 5 were distinctly associated with **Skill\_3**, particularly highlighted in both PCA and Factor Analysis.
- **Visual Confirmation**: Heatmaps illustrated the relationships clearly, indicating strong loadings for items corresponding to specific skills. Individual bar charts helped confirm these findings by breaking down each item's relationship with all skills.
- **Iterative Testing**: I tested models with different component numbers. The two-component model was overly simplistic, failing to represent some item relationships adequately. The four-component model, while providing additional nuance, introduced unnecessary complexity without significant gain in interpretability.

### Decision-Making Process

The decision to choose the three-component Factor Analysis model was made after careful comparison of different models and their visual representations. It was apparent that this model effectively captured key latent skills without overfitting or oversimplifying the relationships. Thus, the final Q-matrix was chosen based on its ability to coherently explain the data with support from multiple perspectives (Factor Analysis, KMeans, PCA).

## Conclusion

The knowledge structure mapping for the given dataset was successfully identified using a combination of Factor Analysis, KMeans clustering, and PCA. The final Q-matrix presents a clear and evidence-backed mapping of items to underlying skills, which was validated through visualizations and model assessments. The chosen methods and analyses ensured robustness and coherence in uncovering the latent skills being measured by the eight-item test.
