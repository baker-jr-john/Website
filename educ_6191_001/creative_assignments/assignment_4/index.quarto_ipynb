        "  Peer review in mathematics education can foster deeper cognitive engagement and improve learning outcomes by prompting students to reflect on both problem-solving strategies and final answers. However, ensuring the quality and specificity of student feedback remains a persistent challenge, especially at scale. Building upon prior research that utilized neural network models and automated text analysis, this study explores the potential of large language model (LLM) embeddings to refine the detection of process-focused commentary (CP) within peer feedback. Maintaining the same methodological and cross-validation frameworks as previous work, our approach involves applying LLM-based embeddings to student-generated feedback comments from a middle school mathematics digital platform. We further evaluate the model’s ability to generalize to new students who have not contributed to the training data.

        "## Introduction  \n",
        "\n",
        "Peer review has become an increasingly prevalent pedagogy in contemporary classrooms, fostering collaborative learning, promoting deeper cognitive engagement, and improving both communication and domain knowledge. Prior studies have demonstrated that well-structured peer feedback can lead to positive learning outcomes for both the feedback provider and the recipient. However, the efficacy of peer feedback depends upon its quality, as lower-quality comments—those lacking specificity or actionable guidance—are less likely to support meaningful revisions and improvements in students’ work.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of mathematics learning, feedback focusing on how a problem is solved (the “process”) plays a pivotal role in guiding students to refine their reasoning strategies and correct misconceptions. Encouraging students to comment on the problem-solving process rather than just the final answer can help develop critical thinking skills and deepen conceptual understanding. Despite its importance, ensuring that student feedback includes this dimension of process-oriented commentary remains a challenge. Identifying such qualities in large volumes of peer-generated content is resource-intensive when conducted manually.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent advances in automated text analysis and machine learning have enabled more scalable and systematic methods for evaluating feedback quality. Prior work has successfully utilized sentence embeddings, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis to detect attributes such as commenting on the process (CP), commenting on the answer, and relating to self. While these efforts have shown promising results, there is room to improve both accuracy and generalizability. In particular, integrating large language models (LLMs) into the feature representation stage has emerged as a powerful method for capturing nuanced linguistic patterns that may be missed by traditional NLP approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "This study investigates whether incorporating LLM-based embeddings into a neural network model can improve the automated detection of CP attributes in middle school math peer feedback. We follow the same methodological structure as previously documented, ensuring that the neural network architecture, cross-validation procedures, and data sources remain consistent. By holding key experimental parameters constant, we isolate the impact of LLM embeddings on model performance. We also examine model robustness by evaluating performance on data from new students who were not present in the training set, providing a stringent test of the model’s ability to generalize beyond the original sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our findings show that LLM integration leads to substantial improvements in predictive performance, with higher AUC ROC scores and stronger generalizability to unseen learners. These results not only underscore the value of advanced embedding techniques for capturing subtle aspects of student feedback, but they also open the door to more effective, real-time instructional supports. Ultimately, this work contributes to the broader goal of enhancing automated feedback analytics, facilitating more targeted scaffolding in digital learning platforms, and informing educators and researchers about the conditions under which peer review is most likely to support robust mathematical understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Background and Related Work\n",
        "\n",
        "Peer review has gained considerable attention in contemporary educational practice, owing to its potential to foster collaborative learning, enhance students’ domain knowledge, and promote higher-level cognitive engagement. In mathematics classrooms, peer review can provide learners with diverse perspectives on problem-solving approaches, offering commentary on both the correctness of solutions (the product) and the methods employed (the process). When executed effectively, peer feedback can be as beneficial as teacher feedback, helping students refine their conceptual understanding, improve their communication skills, and ultimately strengthen their mathematical proficiency. However, the effectiveness of peer review depends heavily on the quality of the feedback itself. Vague or superficial comments are less likely to spur meaningful revisions and improvements, and many educators remain cautious about adopting this pedagogy due to the challenge of ensuring sufficient feedback quality at scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "In recent years, automated approaches have emerged as a promising avenue to address concerns about feedback quality. Drawing upon advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, researchers have begun to develop scalable methods for systematically categorizing peer feedback. For example, studies have explored identifying salient dimensions of peer comments—such as task specificity, constructiveness, and relevance—using text analysis tools. Work by Nguyen and Litman (2015) leveraged NLP techniques to detect differences in peer feedback for essay writing, examining attributes like problem localization and feedback type. Similarly, Darvishi et al. (2022) integrated automated scaffolds into an AI-assisted learning environment, prompting students to provide more specific and rubric-aligned peer feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "Building on these foundational efforts, the study “Automated Multi-Dimensional Analysis of Peer Feedback in Middle School Mathematics” applied NLP and machine learning to detect critical attributes of peer review comments within a middle school math context. Specifically, the authors categorized peer feedback along three key constructs: commenting on the process (CP), commenting on the answer (CA), and relating to self (RS). The CP dimension centered on whether a student critiqued the methods or steps used to solve a mathematical problem, aligning with theoretical models that emphasize the value of process-oriented guidance for deeper learning and self-regulation. By using sentence embeddings and neural networks, the authors achieved robust predictive models with high AUC ROC scores and demonstrated that these detectors could reliably identify different dimensions of feedback quality. Their results indicated that focusing on multiple aspects of learning—beyond mere correctness—could guide more impactful revisions and foster improved mathematical understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these advances, challenges remain. Existing models are often tuned to the specific platforms and contexts from which their training data are derived, raising questions about transferability and generalizability. Ensuring that models can effectively handle new student populations or different instructional environments is a critical step toward realizing their full potential. Moreover, the increasingly sophisticated NLP landscape offers opportunities to further enhance these predictive models. Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora of textual data have shown substantial improvements in capturing complex linguistic patterns and semantics, outperforming traditional embedding methods on various NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "By integrating LLM-based embeddings into the predictive modeling framework established in “Automated Multi-Dimensional Analysis of Peer Feedback in Middle School Mathematics,” our work aims to advance the field beyond the original state-of-the-art. While we maintain the same neural network architecture and rigorous cross-validation schemes to ensure comparability, the integration of LLMs seeks to deepen the model’s understanding of subtle linguistic cues indicative of high-quality process-focused feedback. In doing so, we extend prior research both by refining the predictive accuracy of automated feedback analysis tools and by validating the models’ applicability to new student cohorts, providing stronger evidence of their potential utility in diverse educational settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methods Used\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data and Construct Operationalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "This study used the same dataset of peer feedback comments from a middle school mathematics digital learning platform as described in the prior work. Each student-generated comment (N = 229) was associated with a particular problem-solving artifact—a Thinklet—that the student reviewed. To maintain consistency, the coding scheme and constructs remained unchanged, with the presence of “Commenting on the Process” (CP) serving as the primary outcome variable. Following established protocols, each comment had been hand-labeled by trained coders, achieving acceptable levels of inter-rater reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Embedding Generation via LLM Integration\n",
        "\n",
        "Departing from the original study’s methodology, which employed pre-trained sentence embeddings (Cer et al., 2018), this investigation leveraged a large language model (LLM) to produce high-dimensional embeddings. Each student comment was transformed into a semantic representation using OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 model. This model, trained on extensive textual corpora, captures subtle linguistic patterns and contextual nuances that may not be fully represented in simpler embedding schemes. To ensure robustness, we implemented an exponential backoff strategy when retrieving embeddings, thereby mitigating issues related to rate limits and network latency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Neural Network Architecture and Training Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "We replicated the neural network design and hyperparameters from the previous work to allow direct comparability of results. Specifically, the model was a feed-forward neural network with multiple dense layers using ReLU activations, followed by a single sigmoid-activated output neuron for binary classification. The input layer’s dimensions were adjusted to match the dimensionality of the LLM-based embeddings, but the number of hidden units, activation functions, optimization strategy (Adam), loss function (binary cross-entropy), and other parameters remained unchanged. The model was trained for a fixed number of epochs (30) with a batch size of 10, and a validation split of 10% was used for early stopping and monitoring. All other training protocols, including shuffling and the order of samples, replicated the original procedures.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cross-Validation and Group Assignments\n",
        "\n",
        "Consistent with the previous study, we applied a student-level 5-fold cross-validation scheme using GroupKFold from scikit-learn. Each student’s comments were assigned to exactly one fold to prevent data leakage across training and testing sets. In other words, if any of a student’s comments appeared in the training data, none of their comments would appear in the corresponding test data. This procedure ensures that the evaluation metrics reflect the model’s ability to generalize to new students rather than memorizing the linguistic style of specific individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "Model performance was evaluated using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC ROC), chosen for its ability to summarize discriminative performance without dependence on a single decision threshold. We report the mean AUC ROC across folds, as well as the standard deviation and maximum AUC ROC, to provide a comprehensive understanding of both average performance and stability. These statistics were computed for the cross-validation folds and, separately, for the new student group to provide evidence of the model’s predictive consistency and external validity.\n",
        "\n",
        "By maintaining fidelity to the original methodological choices—such as the neural network architecture, cross-validation strategy, and operationalization of the CP construct—while introducing LLM-based embeddings, this study isolates and highlights the impact of more advanced linguistic representations on model effectiveness and generalizability.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implementation Details\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is a detailed description of the implementation steps taken to build and evaluate a predictive model for Commenting on the Process (CP), including representative code snippets. This implementation adheres closely to the methodological framework and neural network architecture described in the original study, while introducing large language model (LLM) embeddings to enhance feature representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Preparation\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The initial step involves loading the dataset, which contains comments annotated with the presence or absence of the CP construct. Each data row includes the text of the student’s comment, the student’s unique identifier, and a binary label for whether the comment contains process-focused feedback. We also ensure that the grouping of students into folds is consistent with the original experimental design, preventing any given student’s work from appearing in both training and test sets.\n"

        "In addition to an elevated mean performance, the maximum AUC ROC attained across folds exceeded 0.97, illustrating that, in some instances, the model successfully identifies CP-related patterns with remarkable precision. The standard deviation of roughly 0.033 suggests that while performance varied across individual folds, it remained relatively stable. Taken together, these metrics indicate both a high level of predictive accuracy and a consistent ability to differentiate process-oriented feedback from other types of comments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Crucially, these improvements in predictive performance were validated not only through standard cross-validation but also via a stringent test of model generalizability. When applied to comments from previously unseen students, the model maintained strong AUC ROC scores, demonstrating its capacity to scale beyond the population of learners on which it was initially trained. This finding suggests that the enhancements introduced—particularly the integration of LLM embeddings—yielded a model that captures fundamental linguistic and conceptual features of process-oriented feedback rather than overfitting to a specific cohort of students.\n",
        "\n",
        "In comparison to the original work, our approach yields a model that is not only more accurate but also more robust. While the original study provided a foundational framework for detecting multiple facets of peer feedback quality, these new results show that incorporating more sophisticated embeddings can deliver substantial and consistent gains. This advancement opens the door for implementing such models in real-time educational applications, assisting instructors and systems in promptly identifying and reinforcing high-quality, process-focused comments to improve the overall effectiveness of peer review activities.\n",

        "## Discussion  \n",
        "\n",
        "This study demonstrates that integrating large language model (LLM) embeddings into the predictive modeling of peer feedback attributes can substantially enhance model performance, particularly for detecting comments that focus on the problem-solving process (CP) in middle school mathematics. By adhering to the methodological frameworks, neural network architectures, and cross-validation strategies established in *Automated Multi-Dimensional Analysis of Peer Feedback in Middle School Mathematics*, we ensured that the observed improvements could be attributed primarily to the introduction of LLM embeddings rather than changes in experimental design or training procedures. The resulting gains in AUC ROC, both on previously known and entirely new student groups, underscore the robustness and scalability of this approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key finding is that the updated model consistently outperforms previously reported baselines that relied on sentence embeddings or simpler text representations. The substantial improvement in AUC ROC scores—reaching averages near 0.94 and occasionally approaching 0.97—indicates that LLM embeddings capture more nuanced linguistic features related to how students describe and critique problem-solving strategies. This suggests that the semantic depth and contextual sensitivity of LLM-generated embeddings can facilitate the automatic identification of subtle cues embedded in student commentary, thus enabling more accurate and fine-grained classification of feedback attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The strong performance on data from new, previously unseen students provides compelling evidence for the model’s generalizability. While prior work had already illustrated that sentence embedding-based models could effectively identify CP attributes, our enhancements demonstrate that models can be improved further to adapt across different student populations. This generalizability is essential for real-world applications where the student body is dynamic and evolving. The capacity to maintain robust accuracy when presented with new learners’ feedback comments bodes well for scalable deployment in digital learning environments and could lead to more equitable support for learners from diverse backgrounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these promising outcomes, limitations remain. The integration of LLM embeddings, while beneficial, may introduce practical constraints related to computational resources, data privacy, or access to high-quality pretrained language models. Future studies should examine how these factors influence the feasibility and sustainability of implementing such models in large-scale educational contexts. Additionally, although the present study preserved fidelity to the original methodology, more extensive comparisons to alternative architectures, hyperparameter settings, and downstream applications would further illuminate the boundaries and best uses of LLM-augmented models. Investigations into other pedagogically relevant constructs or different subject areas would clarify whether the observed performance gains can generalize beyond the mathematics domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this work provides compelling evidence that integrating LLM embeddings into established modeling frameworks can markedly enhance the detection of process-focused feedback in middle school mathematics. The gains in accuracy, stability, and generalizability highlight the promise of advanced NLP techniques for improving peer review support, enabling more timely and targeted scaffolding of students’ mathematical reasoning processes. As automated feedback analytics continue to evolve, refining such approaches and extending them across diverse contexts and content areas will remain a productive avenue for improving instructional support in digital learning environments.\n",

        "## Conclusion  \n",
        "\n",
        "This study demonstrates that integrating large language model (LLM) embeddings into a previously established neural network framework can significantly improve the detection of process-focused commentary (CP) in peer feedback from middle school mathematics classrooms. By maintaining strict adherence to the original experimental design, including the neural architecture and cross-validation methodology, we isolated the effect of LLM embeddings as the primary driver of these performance gains. The resulting model outperforms prior benchmarks reported in *Automated Multi-Dimensional Analysis of Peer Feedback in Middle School Mathematics*, achieving higher AUC ROC scores, reduced variability, and robust generalizability to new student populations.\n",
        "\n",
        "These findings underscore the value of advanced embedding techniques in capturing subtle linguistic nuances of student feedback, thereby enhancing both accuracy and applicability. Not only does this approach yield a more refined and scalable tool for researchers studying peer review interactions, but it also has practical implications for educators and developers of digital learning environments. By better identifying process-focused feedback in real-time, these models can support targeted scaffolding, encourage deeper cognitive engagement, and ultimately foster more meaningful learning experiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking ahead, future work should investigate how these improvements transfer across other constructs, subjects, and instructional settings. Additional explorations into the interpretability of LLM-based models, resource requirements for deployment at scale, and integration with adaptive learning platforms will further clarify the potential of this approach. Ultimately, the incorporation of LLM embeddings marks a promising direction in the quest to enhance the quality and impact of peer feedback in education.\n",
