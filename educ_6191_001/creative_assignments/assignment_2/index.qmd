## Introduction

Understanding student behavior within educational software environments is crucial for providing timely interventions and enhancing learning outcomes. Off-task behavior, in particular, can negatively impact learning efficacy. Accurate detection of such behavior allows educators to address issues promptly and tailor educational experiences to individual student needs.

This project builds upon previous work by engineering new features derived from detailed logs of student interactions. By integrating these features with existing ones and applying advanced machine learning techniques, I aim to develop an improved behavior detector that can more accurately identify off-task behaviors.

## Literature Review

### Detecting Off-Task Behavior and Addressing Algorithmic Bias in Learning Systems

Educational Data Mining (EDM) has emerged as a significant field, leveraging student data to enhance learning outcomes. Recent research has focused on developing algorithms and metrics to address algorithmic bias in education and other related fields [@cohausz2024fairness]. Analyzing student data can provide valuable insights into factors influencing academic performance, including social connections [@siemens2012learning].

A particularly relevant area within EDM for this study is detecting student misuse of educational systems. Baker and Siemens [@siemens2012learning] explored how data mining techniques can identify instances where students "game the system" in constraint-based tutors. This concept is pertinent to identifying off-task behavior, a broader category of student misuse.

Off-task behavior encompasses actions where students deviate from their intended engagement with educational software, including disengagement, inappropriate tool use, or attempts to circumvent learning activities. "Gaming the system" [@baker2009state] can be understood as a specific manifestation of off-task behavior in which students exploit system mechanics to achieve desired outcomes without genuine engagement.

Other relevant methodologies and ethical considerations include:

1. The use of "text replays" to gain a deeper understanding of student behavior [@sao2012improving; @slater2020iterative], which could potentially be adapted for analyzing off-task behavior patterns.

2. Addressing fairness and bias in machine learning models used in educational contexts [@cohausz2024fairness; @baker2022algorithmic], ensuring that models for detecting off-task behavior are equitable and do not unfairly disadvantage certain student groups.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation

I began by importing essential libraries for data manipulation and machine learning, loading the datasets (`ca1` and `ca2`) from CSV files.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, VotingClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GroupKFold, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, cohen_kappa_score
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from collections import Counter
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE

# Load datasets
ca1 = pd.read_csv('data/ca1-dataset.csv')
ca2 = pd.read_csv('data/ca2-dataset.csv')
```

- **`ca1-dataset.csv`**: Contains existing features related to student interactions.
- **`ca2-dataset.csv`**: Provides detailed logs of student actions, from which new features are engineered.

Both datasets were imported into Pandas dataframes for manipulation and analysis.

#### Dataset Overview

**`ca1-dataset.csv`:**

- **Entries:** 763 rows
- **Columns:** 27
- **Data Types:** Numeric and categorical
- **Missing Values:** None

**`ca2-dataset.csv`:**

- **Entries:** 1,745 rows
- **Columns:** 34
- **Data Types:** Numeric and categorical
- **Missing Values:** None

Key insights:
- The `ca1-dataset.csv` contains aggregated data for 20-second intervals, while `ca2-dataset.csv` provides more granular information about individual student actions.
- Both datasets share a common `Unique-id` field, allowing for integration of the new features.

Preprocessing steps:
1. Converted categorical variables to numerical using one-hot encoding.
2. Normalized numerical features to ensure consistent scale across all variables.

### Feature Engineering

From `ca2-dataset.csv`, I engineered several user-specific features to capture behavioral patterns:

1. **Action Frequency:** Total number of actions per user within the 20-second interval.
   - Calculation: Count of actions for each `Unique-id`.
   - Rationale: Higher frequency may indicate engagement or potentially off-task rapid clicking.

2. **Average Time Between Actions:** Mean time interval between consecutive actions.
   - Calculation: Mean of time differences between consecutive actions for each `Unique-id`.
   - Rationale: Longer intervals might suggest disengagement or thoughtful consideration.

3. **Maximum Action Duration:** Longest time interval between actions.
   - Calculation: Maximum time difference between consecutive actions for each `Unique-id`.
   - Rationale: Extremely long durations could indicate off-task behavior or system issues.

4. **Action Diversity:** Number of unique actions performed.
   - Calculation: Count of distinct action types for each `Unique-id`.
   - Rationale: Higher diversity might indicate more engaged, on-task behavior.

5. **Idle Time Ratio:** Proportion of time spent idle (no actions recorded).
   - Calculation: Sum of time intervals exceeding 5 seconds divided by total interval time.
   - Rationale: Higher idle time may suggest off-task behavior or disengagement.

```{python}
# Action Frequency, Avg Time Between Actions, Max Action Duration, Action Diversity, Idle/Active Ratio
action_freq = ca2.groupby('Unique-id')['Row'].count().reset_index()
action_freq.columns = ['Unique-id', 'Action_Frequency']

ca2['time'] = pd.to_datetime(ca2['time'], errors='coerce')
ca2 = ca2.sort_values(by=['Unique-id', 'time'])
ca2['Time_Diff'] = ca2.groupby('Unique-id')['time'].diff().dt.total_seconds()
avg_time_diff = ca2.groupby('Unique-id')['Time_Diff'].mean().reset_index()
avg_time_diff.columns = ['Unique-id', 'Avg_Time_Between_Actions']

max_time_diff = ca2.groupby('Unique-id')['Time_Diff'].max().reset_index()
max_time_diff.columns = ['Unique-id', 'Max_Action_Duration']

action_diversity = ca2.groupby('Unique-id')['prod'].nunique().reset_index()
action_diversity.columns = ['Unique-id', 'Action_Diversity']

ca2['Idle_Time'] = ca2['Time_Diff'].apply(lambda x: x if x > 60 else 0)
total_idle_time = ca2.groupby('Unique-id')['Idle_Time'].sum().reset_index()
total_active_time = ca2.groupby('Unique-id')['Time_Diff'].sum().reset_index()
total_active_time.columns = ['Unique-id', 'Total_Active_Time']
idle_active_ratio = total_idle_time.merge(total_active_time, on='Unique-id')
idle_active_ratio['Idle_Active_Ratio'] = idle_active_ratio['Idle_Time'] / idle_active_ratio['Total_Active_Time']
```

These features aim to quantify user engagement and detect patterns indicative of off-task behavior.

### Data Merging and Cleaning

The new features were merged with `ca1-dataset.csv` based on the `Unique-id` key. Missing values in numerical columns were handled using mean imputation to ensure the integrity of the dataset for modeling. Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding to prepare them for machine learning algorithms.

```{python}
# Merging the new features into the original ca1-dataset.csv
ca1_enhanced = ca1.merge(action_freq, on='Unique-id', how='left')
ca1_enhanced = ca1_enhanced.merge(avg_time_diff, on='Unique-id', how='left')
ca1_enhanced = ca1_enhanced.merge(max_time_diff, on='Unique-id', how='left')
ca1_enhanced = ca1_enhanced.merge(action_diversity, on='Unique-id', how='left')
ca1_enhanced = ca1_enhanced.merge(idle_active_ratio[['Unique-id', 'Idle_Active_Ratio']], on='Unique-id', how='left')

# Handling missing values using mean imputation
numeric_cols = ca1_enhanced.select_dtypes(include=['number']).columns
ca1_enhanced[numeric_cols] = ca1_enhanced[numeric_cols].fillna(ca1_enhanced[numeric_cols].mean())
```

### Model Development

I developed two primary models to compare the effectiveness of the newly engineered features:

#### Model 1: Original Features

A Random Forest Classifier was trained using only the original features from `ca1-dataset.csv`. This serves as a baseline model to evaluate the impact of the new features. The target variable was the `OffTask` indicator, converted to a binary format.

```{python}
# Model Development using RandomForestClassifier
original_features = ['Avgright', 'Avgbug', 'Avghelp', 'Avgchoice', 'Avgstring', 'Avgnumber', 'Avgpoint', 'Avgpchange', 'Avgtime', 'AvgtimeSDnormed', 'Avgtimelast3SDnormed', 'Avgtimelast5SDnormed', 'Avgnotright', 'Avghowmanywrong-up', 'Avghelppct-up', 'Avgwrongpct-up', 'Avgtimeperact-up', 'AvgPrev3Count-up', 'AvgPrev5Count-up', 'Avgrecent8help', 'Avg recent5wrong', 'Avgmanywrong-up', 'AvgasymptoteA-up', 'AvgasymptoteB-up']

# Separate features and target variable ('OffTask')
X_original = ca1_enhanced[original_features]
y = ca1_enhanced['OffTask'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'Y' else 0)

# Split the dataset into train and test sets
X_train_orig, X_test_orig, y_train_orig, y_test_orig = train_test_split(X_original, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build the RandomForest model
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train_orig, y_train_orig)

# Predict and evaluate the model
y_pred_orig = rf.predict(X_test_orig)
auc_orig = roc_auc_score(y_test_orig, y_pred_orig)
kappa_orig = cohen_kappa_score(y_test_orig, y_pred_orig)
print(f"AUC: {auc_orig}, Kappa: {kappa_orig}")
```

#### Model 2: Combined Features

The second model incorporated both original and new features. I performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest Classifier.

```{python}
#| output: false

# Combined Features
new_features = ['Action_Frequency', 'Avg_Time_Between_Actions', 'Max_Action_Duration', 'Action_Diversity', 'Idle_Active_Ratio']
X_combined = ca1_enhanced[original_features + new_features]
X_train_comb, X_test_comb, y_train_comb, y_test_comb = train_test_split(X_combined, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the parameter grid
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4],
    'bootstrap': [True, False]
}

# Initialize the RandomForestClassifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)

# Initialize GridSearchCV
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=rf, param_grid=param_grid, cv=3, n_jobs=-1, verbose=2, scoring='roc_auc')

# Fit GridSearchCV
grid_search.fit(X_train_comb, y_train_comb)

# Get the best parameters
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
```
```{python}
print(f'Best parameters found: {best_params}')
```

Based on the grid search, the best model configuration is a `RandomForestClassifier` with:

- **No bootstrapping** (`bootstrap=False`)
- **Maximum depth of 10** (`max_depth=10`)
- **Minimum of 2 samples per leaf node** (`min_samples_leaf=2`)
- **Minimum of 2 samples required to split an internal node** (`min_samples_split=2`)
- **100 decision trees** (`n_estimators=100`)

```{python}
# Train the model with the best parameters
best_rf = RandomForestClassifier(**best_params, random_state=42)
best_rf.fit(X_train_comb, y_train_comb)
y_pred_comb = best_rf.predict(X_test_comb)

# Evaluate the model
auc_comb = roc_auc_score(y_test_comb, y_pred_comb)
kappa_comb = cohen_kappa_score(y_test_comb, y_pred_comb)
print(f'AUC for Combined Features with Best Params: {auc_comb}')
print(f'Kappa for Combined Features with Best Params: {kappa_comb}')
```

### Addressing Class Imbalance with SMOTE and Ensemble Modeling

To address potential class imbalance in the dataset, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied only to the training set during each fold of cross-validation. This approach ensures that the test set remains unaltered and representative of the true data distribution.

An ensemble model comprising a Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Classifier was built using a soft voting strategy. This ensemble approach aims to leverage the strengths of different algorithms and improve overall prediction accuracy.

```{python}
# Separate features and target variable
X = ca1_enhanced[original_features + new_features]
y = ca1_enhanced['OffTask'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'Y' else 0)

# Split the dataset into train and test sets before SMOTE
X_train_comb, X_test_comb, y_train_comb, y_test_comb = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Check original class distribution
print(f'Original training set class distribution: {Counter(y_train_comb)}')

# Apply SMOTE to balance the training data
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train_comb, y_train_comb)

# Check class distribution after SMOTE
print(f'Resampled training set class distribution: {Counter(y_train_resampled)}')

# Initialize the scaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit the scaler on the training data and transform both training and test data
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train_resampled)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test_comb)

# Initialize individual models with appropriate parameters
rf = RandomForestClassifier(**best_params, random_state=42)
lr = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=1000)
svc = SVC(probability=True, random_state=42)

# Create an ensemble model
ensemble = VotingClassifier(
    estimators=[('rf', rf), ('lr', lr), ('svc', svc)],
    voting='soft'
)

# Train the ensemble model
ensemble.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train_resampled)

# Predict on the scaled test data
y_pred_comb = ensemble.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Evaluate the ensemble model
auc_comb = roc_auc_score(y_test_comb, y_pred_comb)
kappa_comb = cohen_kappa_score(y_test_comb, y_pred_comb)
print(f'AUC for Combined Features with Ensemble: {auc_comb}')
print(f'Kappa for Combined Features with Ensemble: {kappa_comb}')
```

### Cross-Validation Strategy

To ensure the model's generalizability and prevent overfitting, I employed GroupKFold cross-validation based on `Unique-id`. This approach prevents data from the same student appearing in both training and testing sets, thereby providing a more robust evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data.

Implementation:

```{python}
# Cross-validation using GroupKFold with the ensemble model
gkf = GroupKFold(n_splits=5)
groups = ca1_enhanced['Unique-id']

auc_scores_comb = []
kappa_scores_comb = []

for train_idx, test_idx in gkf.split(X_combined, y, groups=groups):
    X_train_comb, X_test_comb = X_combined.iloc[train_idx], X_combined.iloc[test_idx]
    y_train_comb, y_test_comb = y.iloc[train_idx], y.iloc[test_idx]
    
    # Apply SMOTE to each fold
    X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train_comb, y_train_comb)
    
    ensemble.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)
    y_pred_comb = ensemble.predict(X_test_comb)
    auc_scores_comb.append(roc_auc_score(y_test_comb, y_pred_comb))
    kappa_scores_comb.append(cohen_kappa_score(y_test_comb, y_pred_comb))

# Averaged cross-validation results for combined features with ensemble
avg_auc_comb = sum(auc_scores_comb) / len(auc_scores_comb)
avg_kappa_comb = sum(kappa_scores_comb) / len(kappa_scores_comb)
print(f'Average AUC for Combined Features with Ensemble: {avg_auc_comb}')
print(f'Average Kappa for Combined Features with Ensemble: {avg_kappa_comb}')
```

This approach ensures that our model evaluation reflects its ability to generalize to new students, which is crucial for real-world application in educational settings.

### Feature Selection

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was utilized to identify the top 10 most significant features. This step aimed to enhance model performance by reducing overfitting and improving computational efficiency. The selected features were used consistently across all folds of the cross-validation process.

```{python}
# Perform Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
rfe = RFE(estimator=rf, n_features_to_select=10, step=1)
rfe.fit(X_combined, y)

# Get the selected features
selected_features = X_combined.columns[rfe.support_]

# Use only the selected features for training and testing
X_combined_selected = X_combined[selected_features]

# Apply SMOTE to balance the dataset
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_combined_selected, y)

# Split the resampled data
X_train_comb, X_test_comb, y_train_comb, y_test_comb = train_test_split(X_resampled, y_resampled, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the ensemble model with selected features
ensemble.fit(X_train_comb, y_train_comb)
y_pred_comb = ensemble.predict(X_test_comb)

# Evaluate the ensemble model with selected features
auc_comb = roc_auc_score(y_test_comb, y_pred_comb)
kappa_comb = cohen_kappa_score(y_test_comb, y_pred_comb)
print(f'AUC for Combined Features with Ensemble and RFE: {auc_comb}')
print(f'Kappa for Combined Features with Ensemble and RFE: {kappa_comb}')
```

#### Cross-Validation with Selected Features

```{python}
# Cross-validation using GroupKFold with the ensemble model and selected features
auc_scores_comb = []
kappa_scores_comb = []

for train_idx, test_idx in gkf.split(X_combined_selected, y, groups=groups):
    X_train_comb, X_test_comb = X_combined_selected.iloc[train_idx], X_combined_selected.iloc[test_idx]
    y_train_comb, y_test_comb = y.iloc[train_idx], y.iloc[test_idx]
    
    # Apply SMOTE to each fold
    X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train_comb, y_train_comb)
    
    ensemble.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)
    y_pred_comb = ensemble.predict(X_test_comb)
    auc_scores_comb.append(roc_auc_score(y_test_comb, y_pred_comb))
    kappa_scores_comb.append(cohen_kappa_score(y_test_comb, y_pred_comb))

# Averaged cross-validation results for combined features with ensemble and RFE
avg_auc_comb = sum(auc_scores_comb) / len(auc_scores_comb)
avg_kappa_comb = sum(kappa_scores_comb) / len(kappa_scores_comb)
print(f'Average AUC for Combined Features with Ensemble and RFE: {avg_auc_comb}')
print(f'Average Kappa for Combined Features with Ensemble and RFE: {avg_kappa_comb}')
```

- **Average Cohen's Kappa:** 0.240 (std: 0.038)

### Interpretation of Results

1. **Baseline Model:** The original features provided modest predictive power, performing slightly better than random guessing.

2. **Feature Engineering Impact:** Incorporating new features significantly improved model performance, with AUC increasing from 0.583 to 0.75 and Cohen's Kappa from 0.278 to 0.658.

3. **Ensemble and SMOTE Effect:** Addressing class imbalance and using ensemble methods further improved AUC to 0.803, though Cohen's Kappa decreased slightly.

4. **Feature Selection Benefit:** RFE led to a substantial performance boost, achieving an AUC of 0.942 and Cohen's Kappa of 0.884 on the test set.

5. **Cross-Validation Insights:** The cross-validation results (AUC: 0.730, Kappa: 0.240) suggest potential overfitting, highlighting the importance of robust validation techniques.

## Discussion

The progressive enhancements in model performance demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature engineering and model optimization techniques:

1. **Feature Engineering:** The introduction of new features derived from `ca2-dataset.csv` substantially improved the model's ability to detect off-task behavior. This indicates that these features capture significant aspects of student interactions related to off-task activities.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the Random Forest parameters led to better model performance, highlighting the importance of tailoring the model to the data characteristics.

3. **Addressing Class Imbalance:** Applying SMOTE balanced the training data, which is crucial when dealing with imbalanced classes. The increase in AUC after SMOTE suggests that the model became better at distinguishing between the classes.

4. **Ensemble Modeling:** Combining different algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVC) in an ensemble improved the robustness of the predictions. The ensemble model benefits from the strengths of each individual classifier.

5. **Feature Selection with RFE:** Reducing the feature set to the most significant 10 features using RFE not only simplified the model but also enhanced performance. This suggests that these features are highly predictive of off-task behavior and that removing less important features can reduce noise and prevent overfitting.

6. **Cross-Validation Insights:** The cross-validation results, while lower than the test set scores, are critical for assessing how the model might perform on new, unseen data. The lower scores indicate potential overfitting, and they highlight the need for further model validation or potential adjustments.

### Implications for Educational Interventions

- The top features identified can help educators understand which behaviors are most indicative of off-task activities.
- Real-time monitoring systems can be developed using these key features to alert educators when a student may need intervention.
- The improved accuracy of off-task behavior detection can lead to more timely and targeted support for students, potentially improving learning outcomes.

## Limitations and Future Work

Despite the promising results, several limitations must be acknowledged:

1. **Dataset Size:** The relatively small dataset may limit the model's generalizability to broader student populations.

2. **Potential Overfitting:** The discrepancy between test set and cross-validation performance suggests potential overfitting, which needs to be addressed in future iterations.

3. **Feature Availability:** Some engineered features may not be immediately available in real-time scenarios, potentially limiting the model's applicability in live educational settings.

4. **External Validation:** The model has not been tested on external datasets or in real-world educational environments, which is crucial for assessing its true effectiveness.

Future work should focus on:

1. **Expanding the Dataset:** Collecting more diverse data from a larger student population to improve model generalizability.

2. **Real-time Feature Engineering:** Developing methods to calculate and update features in real-time for live intervention systems.

3. **Advanced Model Architectures:** Exploring deep learning approaches or more sophisticated ensemble methods that might capture complex patterns in student behavior.

4. **Longitudinal Studies:** Conducting long-term studies to assess the model's effectiveness in improving student engagement and learning outcomes over time.

5. **Interpretability:** Developing tools to explain model predictions to educators and students, ensuring transparency and trust in the system.
