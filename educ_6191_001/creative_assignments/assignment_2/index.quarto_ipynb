        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding student behavior within educational software environments is crucial for providing timely interventions and enhancing learning outcomes. Off-task behavior, in particular, can negatively impact learning efficacy. Accurate detection of such behavior allows educators to address issues promptly and tailor educational experiences to individual student needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project builds upon previous work by engineering new features derived from detailed logs of student interactions. By integrating these features with existing ones and applying advanced machine learning techniques, I aim to develop an improved behavior detector that can more accurately identify off-task behaviors.\n",

        "### Detecting Off-Task Behavior and Addressing Algorithmic Bias in Learning Systems\n",
        "\n",
        "Educational Data Mining (EDM) has emerged as a significant field, leveraging student data to enhance learning outcomes. Recent research has focused on developing algorithms and metrics to address algorithmic bias in education and other related fields [@cohausz2024fairness]. Analyzing student data can provide valuable insights into factors influencing academic performance, including social connections [@siemens2012learning].\n",
        "\n",
        "A particularly relevant area within EDM for this study is detecting student misuse of educational systems. Baker and Siemens [@siemens2012learning] explored how data mining techniques can identify instances where students \"game the system\" in constraint-based tutors. This concept is pertinent to identifying off-task behavior, a broader category of student misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "Off-task behavior encompasses actions where students deviate from their intended engagement with educational software, including disengagement, inappropriate tool use, or attempts to circumvent learning activities. \"Gaming the system\" [@baker2009state] can be understood as a specific manifestation of off-task behavior in which students exploit system mechanics to achieve desired outcomes without genuine engagement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other relevant methodologies and ethical considerations include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The use of \"text replays\" to gain a deeper understanding of student behavior [@sao2012improving; @slater2020iterative], which could potentially be adapted for analyzing off-task behavior patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Addressing fairness and bias in machine learning models used in educational contexts [@cohausz2024fairness; @baker2022algorithmic], ensuring that models for detecting off-task behavior are equitable and do not unfairly disadvantage certain student groups.\n",

        "\n",
        "To ensure the modelâ€™s generalizability and prevent overfitting, I initially employed GroupKFold cross-validation based on `Unique-id`. However, based on feedback from [Jiayi Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jzhang7718/), I updated my strategy to employ GroupKFold cross-validation based on `namea`. This approach groups data by students, ensuring all data from one student is used for training or testing, not split between both. It prevents data leakage across folds, as logs from the same student will not appear in both setsâ€”crucial in educational data mining due to highly individual student behavior. Cross-validating based on `namea` allows the model to learn from some studentsâ€™ behavior patterns and generalize to others, mirroring real-world usage where the detector should work for new students. This method better indicates the modelâ€™s ability to generalize and ensures a more robust, fair evaluation.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Baseline Model:** The original features provided modest predictive power, performing slightly better than random guessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Engineering Impact:** Incorporating new features significantly improved model performance, with AUC increasing from 0.583 to 0.75 and Cohen's Kappa from 0.278 to 0.658.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Ensemble and SMOTE Effect:** Addressing class imbalance and using ensemble methods further improved AUC to 0.803, though Cohen's Kappa decreased slightly.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Feature Selection Benefit:** RFE led to a substantial performance boost, achieving an AUC of 0.942 and Cohen's Kappa of 0.884 on the test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Cross-Validation Insights:** The cross-validation results (AUC: 0.760, Kappa: 0.265) suggest potential overfitting, highlighting the importance of robust validation techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Discussion\n",
        "\n",
        "The progressive enhancements in model performance demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature engineering and model optimization techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Feature Engineering:** The introduction of new features derived from `ca2-dataset.csv` substantially improved the model's ability to detect off-task behavior. This indicates that these features capture significant aspects of student interactions related to off-task activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the Random Forest parameters led to better model performance, highlighting the importance of tailoring the model to the data characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Addressing Class Imbalance:** Applying SMOTE balanced the training data, which is crucial when dealing with imbalanced classes. The increase in AUC after SMOTE suggests that the model became better at distinguishing between the classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Ensemble Modeling:** Combining different algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVC) in an ensemble improved the robustness of the predictions. The ensemble model benefits from the strengths of each individual classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Feature Selection with RFE:** Reducing the feature set to the most significant 10 features using RFE not only simplified the model but also enhanced performance. This suggests that these features are highly predictive of off-task behavior and that removing less important features can reduce noise and prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Cross-Validation Insights:** The cross-validation results, while lower than the test set scores, are critical for assessing how the model might perform on new, unseen data. The lower scores indicate potential overfitting, and they highlight the need for further model validation or potential adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implications for Educational Interventions\n",
        "\n",
        "- The top features identified can help educators understand which behaviors are most indicative of off-task activities.\n",
        "- Real-time monitoring systems can be developed using these key features to alert educators when a student may need intervention.\n",
        "- The improved accuracy of off-task behavior detection can lead to more timely and targeted support for students, potentially improving learning outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Limitations and Future Work\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the promising results, several limitations must be acknowledged:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dataset Size:** The relatively small dataset may limit the model's generalizability to broader student populations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Potential Overfitting:** The discrepancy between test set and cross-validation performance suggests potential overfitting, which needs to be addressed in future iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Feature Availability:** Some engineered features may not be immediately available in real-time scenarios, potentially limiting the model's applicability in live educational settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **External Validation:** The model has not been tested on external datasets or in real-world educational environments, which is crucial for assessing its true effectiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Future work should focus on:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Expanding the Dataset:** Collecting more diverse data from a larger student population to improve model generalizability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Real-time Feature Engineering:** Developing methods to calculate and update features in real-time for live intervention systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Advanced Model Architectures:** Exploring deep learning approaches or more sophisticated ensemble methods that might capture complex patterns in student behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Longitudinal Studies:** Conducting long-term studies to assess the model's effectiveness in improving student engagement and learning outcomes over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Interpretability:** Developing tools to explain model predictions to educators and students, ensuring transparency and trust in the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This study successfully developed an enhanced behavior detector by engineering new features from detailed student interaction data and applying advanced machine learning techniques. The final model demonstrates a high ability to detect off-task behavior, which is crucial for timely educational interventions. \n",
        "\n",
        "Key achievements include:\n",
